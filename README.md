# Personal-Doc

This small program is to be as a quick personal(or shared via repository) documentation access in a terminal.
I personally use it as a infra/devops tool to have quick access to my own commands, and it's super easy and friendly to use! It reuses less in the background to display and navigate the files.

After cloning the project add it to your personal ``bin`` for quick access in the terminal.

## Usage

* ``doc``: Displays all command files: 
* ``doc -a file``: adds a new commands file
* ``doc -e file``: edit a commands file
* ``doc -x file``: moves to the archived folder a file
